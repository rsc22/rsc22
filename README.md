- 👋 Hi, I’m @rsc22
- 👀 I’m interested in many things related to tehcnology! In the digital space, I'm trying to grow my knowledge of programming, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
      But ones and zeros aren't everything! Mechanics, 3D printing, railway and infrastructure projects are other things I love.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and C++, mostly oriented towards Data Science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... Actually I don't know on what! This suggested field is interesting, I haven't thought about collaborative projects yet.
- 📫 You can reach me on my LinkedIn profile: www.linkedin.com/in/ricardo-suarez-carames
